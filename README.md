### Code Formatting

This application uses Prettier for code formatting. If you are using VSCode, you
can install the extension to easily format code.

Code is formatted automatically every time `git add` is run as a pre-commit
hook. This is accomplisehd with husky and lint-staged. See
[Formatting Code Automatically](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor#formatting-code-automatically)
in the Create React App docs.
